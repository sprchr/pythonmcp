# 🚀 Document Q&A MCP Server (with Validation Agent)

A Python-based **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for document-based question answering using OpenAI models.  
Upload documents, ask questions, and receive answers **only when they are fully verified against the source documents**.

> 🛡️ Answers are surfaced **only after an AI Validation Agent confirms they are 100% grounded in document content**, dramatically reducing hallucinations and increasing trust.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **📤 Web File Upload**  
  Drag & drop documents via a browser interface

- **🔍 Semantic Retrieval**  
  Vector search using OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity

- **🤖 AI-Powered Answers**  
  Responses generated strictly from document context

- **🛡️ Validation Agent (Core Feature)**  
  - Verifies answers against retrieved document chunks  
  - Blocks speculative or weakly supported responses  
  - Returns answers **only when fully verified**

- **📊 Confidence Scores**

## 🛡️ Zero-Hallucination Guarantee

If the system cannot confidently verify an answer using the document content, it responds with:

> **“The document does not contain sufficient verified information to answer this question.”**

No guesses. No assumptions. No hallucinations.
